dwarves-dfsg (1.20-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    Changes since 1.19:

    BTF encoder:
      - Improve ELF error reporting using elf_errmsg(elf_errno()).
      - Improve objcopy error handling.
      - Fix handling of 'restrict' qualifier, that was being treated
        as a 'const'.
      - Support SHN_XINDEX in st_shndx symbol indexes, to handle ELF
        objects with more than 65534 sections, for instance, which
        happens with kernels built with 'KCFLAGS="-ffunction-sections
        -fdata-sections", Other cases may include when using FG-ASLR, LTO.
      - Cope with functions without a name, as seen sometimes when
        building kernel images with some versions of clang, when a
        SEGFAULT was taking place.
      - Fix BTF variable generation for kernel modules, not skipping
        variables at offset zero.
      - Fix address size to match what is in the ELF file being
        processed, to fix using a 64-bit pahole binary to generate BTF
        for a 32-bit vmlinux image.
      - Use kernel module ftrace addresses when finding which functions
        to encode, which increases the number of functions encoded.
    DWARF loader:
      - Support DW_AT_data_bit_offset
      - DW_FORM_implicit_const in attr_numeric() and attr_offset()
      - Support DW_TAG_GNU_call_site, its the standardized rename of
        the previously supported DW_TAG_GNU_call_site.
    build:
        - Fix compilation on 32-bit architectures.

  * Refresh patches.
  * Remove ctfdwdiff and README.cross so to reuse upstream tarball as-is.
  * Update Standards-Version to 4.5.1
  * Update debhelper compatibility to 13:
    - install missing binaries: btfdiff and fullcircle
  * Add upstream metadata file
  * gbp: set upstream tarball compression to xz
  * Add lintian override for orig-tarball-missing-upstream-signature,
    see #882694.

dwarves-dfsg (1.19-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release. Closes: #978691.
    Changes since 1.18:
    - Support split BTF, where a main BTF file, vmlinux, can be used
      to find types and then a kernel module, for instance, can have
      just what is unique to it
    - Update libbpf to get the split BTF support and use some of its
      functions to load BTF and speed up DWARF loading and BTF encoding
    - Support cross-compiled ELF binaries with different endianness
    - Support showing typedefs for anonymous types, like structs,
      unions and enums
    - Align enumerators
    - Workaround bugs in the generation of DWARF records for functions in
      some gcc versions that were causing breakage in the encoding of BTF
    - Ignore zero-sized ELF symbols instead of erroring out
    - Handle union forward declaration properly in the BTF loader
    - Introduce --numeric_version for use in scripts and Makefiles
    - Try sole pfunct argument as a function name, just like pahole
      with type names
    - Speed up pfunct using some of the load techniques used in pahole
    - Discard CUs after BTF encoding as they're not used anymore,
      greatly reducing memory usage and speeding up vmlinux BTF encoding
    - Revamp how per-CPU variables are encoded in BTF
    - Include BTF info for static functions
    - Use BTF's string APIs for strings management, greatly improving
      performance over the tsearch()
    - Increase size of DWARF lookup hash table, shaving off about 1
      second out of about 20 seconds total for Linux BTF dedup
    - Stop BTF encoding when errors are found in some DWARF CU
    - Implement --packed, to show just packed structures, for instance,
      here are the top 5 packed data structures in the Linux kernel
    - Fix bug in distros such as OpenSUSE:15.2 where DW_AT_alignment
      isn't defined

  * Refresh patches.

dwarves-dfsg (1.18-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Domenico Andreoli ]
  * New upstream release (changes since 1.17):
    - Use type information to pretty print raw data from stdin, all
      documented in the man pages, further information in the csets.
    - Store percpu variables in vmlinux BTF. This can be disabled when
      debugging kernel features being developed to use it.
    - pahole now should be segfault free when handling gdb test suit
      DWARF files, including ADA, FORTRAN, rust and dwp compressed files,
      the later being just flatly refused, that got left for v1.19.
    - Bail out on partial units for now, avoiding segfaults and providing
      warning to user, hopefully will be addressed in v1.19.
      Closes: #977715.
  * Update Homepage link. Closes: #978708.
  * Drop debian/compat in favor of Build-Depends: debhelper-compat.
  * Fix typo in pahole manual page.
  * Fix escaping in pahole manual page.
  * Fix debian/copyright lintian errors.
  * Revert test to a superficial pahole --version until partial units
    become supported.

  [ Luca Boccassi ]
  * Use packaged libbpf instead of the statically linked. Closes: #979105.

dwarves-dfsg (1.17-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (changes since 1.16):

    BTF loader:
     - Support raw BTF as available in /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux.

    pahole:
     - When the sole argument passed isn't a file, take it as a class name:
     - Do not require a class name to operate without a file name.
     - Make --find_pointers_to consider unions:
     - Make --contains and --find_pointers_to honour --unions
     - Add support for finding pointers to void:
     - Make --contains and --find_pointers_to to work with base types:
     - Make --contains look for more than just unions, structs:
     - Consider unions when looking for classes containing some class:
     - Introduce --unions to consider just unions:
     - Fix -m/--nr_methods - Number of functions operating on a type pointer

    man-pages:
     - Add section about --hex + -E to locate offsets deep into sub structs.
     - Add more information about BTF.
     - Add some examples.

  * Update to Standards-Version 4.5.0:
    - Drop get-orig-source rules target
    - Add Rules-Requires-Root: no
  * Update debhelper compat to 12.

dwarves-dfsg (1.15-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Theodore Y. Ts'o ]
  * New upstream release (changes since 1.12, closes: #931142):
    - Add support for BTF encoding which is a much more compact way
      of encoding C type information.  It is derived from CTF (Compact
      C-Type format) and is designed for use with eBPF.
    - Add initial support for the DWARF DW_TAG_partial_unit
    - Improve support for pretty-printing unions
    - Teach pahole to show where a struct was used, via the -I option
    - Use the running kernel by default when no file name is passed
    - Improve man pages
    - Support new BTF deduplication algorithm found the Linux kernel's
      libbpf library, which allows type information for the kernel to
      be stored in roughly 1% of the space.
    - Add a new utility, btfdiff, which compares the pretty-printed
      type information between two kernel images.
    - Teach pahole to use the BTF information to pretty print structures
      using the BTF information using "pahole -F btf", which is much faster
      than using the Dwarf information.
    - Infer the __packed__ attribute for structures without alignment holes
      and which violate the natural types' alignment requirements.
    - Support DWARF5's DW_AT_alignment tag
    - Add a --compile option to pfunct which produces compileable
      output for function prototypes in an object file.
    - Miscellaneous bug fixes
